# discord-link-bot

Simple discord bot that can read from an API that provides JSON. Used in my own discord to link specific streamers from a curated list.

It will read from the API every day at 15:00 and choose a random streamer to link to the discord.

Other commands have also been added to the bot that will post pictures and gifs
